# GIPHY API Project
Welcome to the GIPHY API Project! This project is a dynamic and interactive website designed to showcase the power of the GIPHY API by providing users with a seamless experience to explore and discover GIFs.

The main focus of this project is to demonstrate the integration and utilization of the GIPHY API to retrieve GIFs based on user input. The project features a user-friendly interface centered around a search bar, enabling users to search for any topic, keyword, emotion, or theme they desire.
